UPDATE: The goal of this fork [poulsbo/appscript](https://github.com/poulsbo/appscript) is to bring the Objective C code up to date so that a working `Appscript.framework` can be built for *embedding* within a 10.8+ OS X app. The various configs are pruned out, leaving only Debug and Release, and both of those are configured for embedding, with default build options.

This is Hamish Sanderson's appscript, imported from sourceforge (svn) to github (git).

Original source: <http://sourceforge.net/projects/appscript>

Hamish has made it very clear that he isn't willing to touch this code any further. So it seems obligatory that someone else should put it in a place and form where people can fork it and continue to maintain it. Here it is, then.

There's no reason in the world, for example, why appscript should stop working just because Hamish insists on using ascr/gdte as a way of fetching an application's dictionary. There are many other ways to fetch the dictionary that work perfectly well with appscript. The next step, clearly, will be to commit some of those into this repository.

Please see the rbappscript folder for my solution (for rb-appscript). It should not be difficult for a Python person to imitate this in Python if desired.

Please fork and let's carry on.
